Objective was to create a filer. <br>
To enable back-office configuration to work all right, please export the db.sql 
into your database, 
and check in the code for connection to database and replace these by your own 
settings <br>
(This is probably boring, but a V2 is being developed. I'll post it when it will be completely done.)


V2 available!!! Go find it <a href="https://github.com/jonathanSimonney/filer-V2"> here </a>
